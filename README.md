## Quick start

```bash
# clone this repo
$ git clone https://github.com/MtDalPizzol/webpack-spa-starter.git my-app

# change directory to your app
$ cd my-app

# install the dependencies with Yarn
$ yarn install

# start the development server
$ yarn start

# Browse to http://localhost:8080
```

## Usage

```bash
# lift the development server
yarn start

# build project to /dist folder without minifying assets
yarn run stage

# build project to /dist folder minifying assets (use this in production)
yarn run build

# same as build but outputs the stats.json file with the profiling of the application and starts the bundle analyzer
yarn run stats
```
